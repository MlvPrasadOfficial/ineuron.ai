    "To understand what deep learning is, we first need to understand the relationship deep learning has with machine learning, neural networks, and artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to think of this relationship is to visualize them as concentric circles:\n",
    "\n",
    "![DL](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/deep-learning/9781491924570/assets/dpln_0101.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At the outer most ring you have artificial intelligence (using computers to reason). One layer inside of that is machine learning. With artificial neural networks and deep learning at the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, deep learning is a more approachable name for an artificial neural network. The “deep” in deep learning refers to the depth of the network. An artificial neural network can be very shallow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are inspired by the structure of the cerebral cortex. At the basic level is the perceptron, the mathematical representation of a biological neuron. Like in the cerebral cortex, there can be several layers of interconnected perceptrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first layer is the input layer. Each node in this layer takes an input, and then passes its output as the input to each node in the next layer. There are generally no connections between nodes in the same layer and the last layer produces the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We call the middle part the hidden layer. These neurons have no connection to the outside (e.g. input or output) and are only activated by nodes in the previous layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "![layer](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/images/tikz11.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of deep learning as the technique for learning in neural networks that utilizes multiple layers of abstraction to solve pattern recognition problems. In the 1980s, most neural networks were a single layer due to the cost of computation and availability of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is considered a branch or approach of Artificial intelligence, whereas deep learning is a specialized type of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning involves computer intelligence that doesn’t know the answers up front. Instead, the program will run against training data, verify the success of its attempts, and modify its approach accordingly. Machine learning typical requires a sophisticated education, spanning software engineering and computer science to statistical methods and linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two broad classes of machine learning methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Supervised learning\n",
    "   * Unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, a machine learning algorithm uses a labeled dataset to infer the desired outcome. This takes a lot of data and time, since the data needs to be labeled by hand. Supervised learning is great for classification and regression problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s say that we were running a company and want to determine the effect of bonuses on employee retention. If we had historical data – i.e. employee bonus amount and tenure – we could use supervised machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "With unsupervised learning, there aren’t any predefined or corresponding answers. The goal is to figure out the hidden patterns in the data. It’s usually used for clustering and associative tasks, like grouping customers by behavior. Amazon’s “customers who also bought…” recommendations are a type of associative task.\n",
    "\n",
    "While supervised learning can be useful, we often have to resort to unsupervised learning. Deep learning has proven to be an effective unsupervised learning technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is Deep Learning Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "![importance](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/andrew-ng-extract-oct2015-nonotes-151124104249-lva1-app6891/95/andrew-ng-chief-scientist-at-baidu-30-638.jpg?cb=1448361887)\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers have long had techniques for recognizing features inside of images. The results weren’t always great. Computer vision has been a main beneficiary of deep learning. Computer vision using deep learning now rivals humans on many image recognition tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Facebook has had great success with identifying faces in photographs by using deep learning. It’s not just a marginal improvement, but a game changer: “Asked whether two unfamiliar photos of faces show the same person, a human being will get it right 97.53 percent of the time. New software developed by researchers at Facebook can score 97.25 percent on the same challenge, regardless of variations in lighting or whether the person in the picture is directly facing the camera.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Speech recognition is a another area that’s felt deep learning’s impact. Spoken languages are so vast and ambiguous. Baidu – one of the leading search engines of China – has developed a voice recognition system that is faster and more accurate than humans at producing text on a mobile phone. In both English and Mandarin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is particularly fascinating, is that generalizing the two languages didn’t require much additional design effort: “Historically, people viewed Chinese and English as two vastly different languages, and so there was a need to design very different features,” Andrew Ng says, chief scientist at Baidu. “The learning algorithms are now so general that you can just learn.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Google is now using deep learning to manage the energy at the company’s data centers. They’ve cut their energy needs for cooling by 40%. That translates to about a 15% improvement in power usage efficiency for the company and hundreds of millions of dollars in savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deep Learning Microservices\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a quick overview of some deep learning use cases and microservices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Illustration Tagger. An implementation of Illustration2Vec, this microservice can tag an image with the safe, questionable, or explicit rating, the copyright, and general category tag to understand what’s in the image. DeepFilter is a style transfer service for applying artistic filters to images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The age classifier uses face detection to determine the age of a person in a photo. The Places 365 Classifier uses a pre-trained CNN and based on Places: An Image Database for Deep Scene Understanding B. Zhou, et al., 2016 to identify particular locations in images, such as a courtyard, drugstore, hotel room, glacier, mountain, etc. Lastly, there is InceptionNet, a direct implementation of Google’s InceptionNet using TensorFlow. It takes an image (such as a car), and returns the top 5 classes the model predicts are relevant to the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Open Source Deep Learning Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learnings is made accessible by a number of open source projects. Some of the most popular technologies include, but are not limited to, Deeplearning4j (DL4j), Theano, Torch, TensorFlow, and Caffe. The deciding factors on which one to use are the tech stack they target, and if they are low-level, academic, or application focused. Here’s an overview of each:\n",

    "## McCulloch and Pitts Neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1943, McCulloch and Pitts introduced a mathematical model of a neuron. It consisted of three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A set of **weights** $w_i$ corresponding to synapses (inputs)\n",
    "2. An **adder** for summing input signals; analogous to cell membrane that collects charge\n",
    "3. An **activation function** for determining when the neuron fires, based on accumulated input\n",
    "\n",
    "The neuron model is shown schematically below. On the left are input nodes $\\{x_i\\}$, usually expressed as a vector. The strength with which the inputs are able to deliver the signal along the synapse is determined by their corresponding weights $\\{w_i\\}$. The adder then sums the inputs from all the synapses:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h = \\sum_i w_i x_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter $\\theta$ determines whether or not the neuron fires given a weighted input of $h$. If it fires, it returns a value $y=1$, otherwise $y=0$. For example, a simple **activation function** is using $\\theta$ as a simple fixed threshold:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = g(h) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "1, \\text{if } h \\gt \\theta \\\\\n",
    "0, \\text{if } h \\le \\theta\n",
    "\\end{array} \\right.$$\n",

    "A single neuron is not interesting, nor useful, from a learning perspective. It cannot learn; it simply receives inputs and either fires or not. Only when neurons are joined as a **network** can they perform useful work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning takes place by changing the weights of the connections in a neural network, and by changing the parameters of the activation functions of neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection of McCullough and Pitts neurons, along with a set of input nodes connected to the inputs via weighted edges, is a perceptron, the simplest neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each neuron is independent of the others in the perceptron, in the sense that its behavior and performance depends only on its own weights and threshold values, and not of those for the other neurons. Though they share inputs, they operate independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of inputs and outputs are determined by the data. Weights are stored as a `N x K` matrix, with N observations and K neurons, with $w_{ij}$ specifying the weight on the *i*th observation on the *j*th neuron.\n",

    "In order to use the perceptron for statistical learning, we compare the outputs $y_j$ from each neuron to the obervation target $t_j$, and adjust the input weights when they do not correspond (*e.g.* if a neuron fires when it should not have).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t_j - y_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We use this difference to update the weight $w_{ij}$, based on the input and a desired **learning rate**. This results in an update rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w_{ij} \\leftarrow w_{ij} + \\eta (t_j - y_j) x_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After an incremental improvement, the perceptron is shown the training data again, resulting in another update. This is repeated until the performance no longer improves. Having a learning rate less than one results in a more stable learning rate, though this stability is traded off against having to expose the network to the data multiple times. Typical learning rates are in the 0.1-0.4 range.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional input node is typically added to the perceptron model, which is a constant value (usually -1, 0, or 1) that acts analogously to an intercept in a regression model. This establishes a baseline input for the case when all inputs are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "![bias](http://d.pr/i/105b5+)\n",

    "### Example: Logical functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how the perceptron learns by training it on a couple of of logical functions, AND and OR. For two variables `x1` and `x2`, the AND function returns 1 if both are true, or zero otherwise; the OR function returns 1 if either variable is true, or both. These functions can be expressed as simple lookup tables."

    "## Multi-layer Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to fitting more complex (*i.e.* non-linear) models with neural networks is to use a more complex network that consists of more than just a single perceptron. The take-home message from the perceptron is that all of the learning happens by adapting the synapse weights until prediction is satisfactory. Hence, a reasonable guess at how to make a perceptron more complex is to simply **add more weights**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to add complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add backward connections, so that output neurons feed back to input nodes, resulting in a **recurrent network**\n",
    "2. Add neurons between the input nodes and the outputs, creating an additional (\"hidden\") layer to the network, resulting in a **multi-layer perceptron**\n",

    "\n",
    "![multilayer](http://d.pr/i/14BS1+)\n",
    "\n",
    "How to train a multilayer network is not intuitive. Propagating the inputs forward over two layers is straightforward, since the outputs from the hidden layer can be used as inputs for the output layer. However, the process for updating the weights based on the prediction error is less clear, since it is difficult to know whether to change the weights on the input layer or on the hidden layer in order to improve the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a matter of: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. moving forward through the network, calculating outputs given inputs and current weight estimates\n",
    "2. moving backward updating weights according to the resulting error from forward propagation. \n",

    "This simple insight leads to the Gradient Descent algorithm. Outlined algorithmically, it looks like this:\n",

    "1. Pick a point $x_0$ as your initial guess.\n",
    "2. Compute the gradient at your current guess:\n",

    "1. Initialize all $w_{jk}$ to small random values\n",

    "Return to (2) and iterate until learning completes. Best practice is to shuffle input vectors to avoid training in the same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its important to be aware that because gradient descent is a hill-climbing (or descending) algorithm, it is liable to be caught in local minima with respect to starting values. Therefore, it is worthwhile training several networks using a range of starting values for the weights, so that you have a better chance of discovering a globally-competitive solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful performance enhancement for the MLP learning algorithm is the addition of **momentum** to the weight updates. This is just a coefficient on the previous weight update that increases the correlation between the current weight and the weight after the next update. This is particularly useful for complex models, where falling into local mimima is an issue; adding momentum will give some weight to the previous direction, making the resulting weights essentially a weighted average of the two directions. Adding momentum, along with a smaller learning rate, usually results in a more stable algorithm with quicker convergence. When we use momentum, we lose this guarantee, but this is generally seen as a small price to pay for the improvement momentum usually gives.\n",
    "\n",
    "A weight update with momentum looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w_{jk} \\leftarrow w_{jk} - \\eta \\delta_k a_j + \\alpha \\Delta w_{jk}^{t-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is the momentum (regularization) parameter and $\\Delta w_{jk}^{t-1}$ the update from the previous iteration.\n",

    "The multi-layer pereptron is implemented below in the `MLP` class. The implementation uses the scikit-learn interface, so it is uses in the same way as other supervised learning algorithms in that package."
