    "\n",
    "Unlike the RCNN series, YOLO treats target detection as a regression problem, and directly uses a network for classification and box regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific method is: divide the image into S * S grids, and each grid predicts the positions (x, y, w, h) of B bboxes, confidence (confidence is the intersection ratio), and class probability. The output dimension is S * S * (B * 5 + C), and C is the number of categories. No matter how many boxes are contained in the grid, each grid only predicts a set of class probabilities. During the test, the conditional class probability and the confidence of the prediction box are multiplied to indicate that each box contains the confidence of a certain type of object. This score can represent the category probability and prediction accuracy of the box at the same time.\n"
